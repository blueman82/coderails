# Runbook: hook and trace observability

Trace rows are NON-AUTHORITATIVE: fail-open, append-only, one `event_id` per event, written by
`hooks/scripts/lib/trace_row.py` to `<agentic-loop dir>/<session_id>/trace.jsonl` (the same per-session directory
`crack_on_gate.py` uses, with or without a loop). Rows hold `schema_version`, `event_id`, `session_id`, `loop_id`
(null outside a loop), `ts`, `command`, `outcome`, `reason_code` and sha256-hashed `inputs`. No gate decision
reads them. Counters dedupe by `event_id`, skip torn lines, and key tallies as `command/outcome/reason_code`.

Query every entry below with:

```
python3 scripts/measure_graph_alignment.py --root . --json | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['trace'])"
```

## No trace rows appear

- Symptom: `trace.rows` is 0 although gates fired (`gate_blocks` counts are nonzero).
- Query: the command above; then `ls ${CLAUDE_AGENTIC_LOOP_DIR:-~/.coderails/agentic-loop}/<session_id>/trace.jsonl`.
- Remediation: the writer fails open, so an unwritable directory or an unsafe session id (contains `/` or `..`,
  or is empty) silently drops rows. Fix the directory permissions; do not make the gate depend on the write.

## Gate seems off (config key or wiki schema)

- Symptom: a configured gate (wiki taxonomy, wiki-debt, integrity, eval signing) does nothing, or a config key seems ignored.
- Query: `python3 scripts/lib/config.py resolve-config --json | jq .unknown_keys` (also `.findings`); counts via
  `python3 scripts/lib/config_counters.py` for `config_unknown_key`, `config_bad_type`, `config_unreadable`,
  `wiki_schema_missing`, `wiki_schema_invalid`, `wiki_schema_legacy` (scope with `--since 2026-10-05T00:00:00`; the same rows
  also appear in `measure_graph_alignment.py --json` under `trace.by_reason`; trace rows: `config/warned/<code>`, `wiki_taxonomy_gate/failed_open/<code>`).
- Remediation: fix the key (the finding carries a did-you-mean hint) or the value type; for `wiki_schema_*` restore or
  repair `wiki.schema.json` (`page_types` non-empty list of directory names). Both are fail-open by design: findings never
  change a gate's decision, and a stale AGENTS.md Page types table fails the build (`config_docs_drift_test.py`), not the hook. `wiki_schema_legacy` means a vault still has only
  `AGENTS-wiki-schema.md`: policing continues from its Page types table; add `wiki.schema.json` to retire the fallback.

## Discipline lint advisories climbing

- Symptom: `confidence_labels` or `verify_loop` advisories climb. These two hooks no longer block (demoted by user
  override, `docs/decisions/2026-10-04-not-in-gate-demotion.md`); the pre-demotion `blocked` series is history.
- Query: `trace.by_reason` for `check_confidence_labels/demoted/confidence_label_missing` and
  `check_verify_loop/demoted/verify_loop_missing` (keys are `command/outcome/reason_code`; `blocked` and `warned`
  rows are the older series and are separate); `gate_blocks.claude.gates.<gate>` for `demoted`/`would_block`.
  `blocked / decisions` now falls to about 0 by construction; compare `demoted / decisions` instead.
- Remediation: a rising `demoted` count means the model is skipping labels or DNV tags, not that a gate is stuck.
  Fix the prompt or instruction text; there is nothing to unblock.

## Reviewer/scout Bash command denied

- Symptom: a read-only reviewer or scout reports a denied Bash call.
- Query: `trace.by_reason` for `reviewer_bash_allowlist/denied/bash_allowlist_deny_<cause>`, cause one of `meta`
  (chaining/redirection), `flag` (dangerous or unknown rg flag), `parse` (bad quoting), `argv` (command not on the list).
  The discipline log line carries `agent_type`, `argv0` and a 12-char sha of the command.
- Remediation: rerun the inspection with a single allowlisted read-only command (no chaining, redirection or
  interpreters). If a legitimate command is missing, add its exact argv prefix to the allowlist with a test.

## Capability tool refused or denied

- Symptom: a reviewer/scout (usually `source-auditor` running `tests.run`) is refused a `scripts/capability.py` call.
- Query: `trace.by_reason` for `reviewer_bash_allowlist/denied/capability_denied_<tool>`,
  `capability_unknown_tool` or `capability_bad_argv` (hook side, one row per decision;
  `reviewer_bash_allowlist/allowed/capability_allowed_<tool>` counts grants), and `capability/refused/capability_*`
  (script side: `args_invalid`, `path_denied`, `bad_ref`, `no_repo`, `tests_unknown_name`, `sandbox_unavailable`, `io_error`). Narrow with
  `python3 scripts/measure_graph_alignment.py --root . --json | jq '.trace.by_reason | with_entries(select(.key|test("capability")))'`.
  Hook rows need a session id (payload `session_id`); script rows use env `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` or `CODEX_THREAD_ID`
  (unverified that the harness sets it) and otherwise land under the `unattributed` session directory. `"traced": false`
  now means only that the trace library or disk failed; the hook also logs `denied=1 reason_code=...` to its log, so an empty query is not proof
  of no refusals.
- Remediation: `capability_denied_*` means the agent's profile lacks the tool; change `capabilities/profiles.json`
  deliberately (the validator test keeps frontmatter and Codex sandboxes in step), never widen Bash. `bad_argv` means
  the call was not exactly `<abs path>/scripts/capability.py <tool> --json-args '<json>'`; the path must be absolute.
  `tests_unknown_name` means the name is not in `profiles.json` `tests`.

## Authority object refused or changed

- Symptom: `authority.py` refuses a command, or an object disappeared.
- Query: `trace.by_reason` for `authority/created|narrowed|revoked` and `authority/refused/authority_refused_<cause>`, cause one of `exists`,
  `widen_scope`, `widen_max_prs`, `narrow_empty`, `not_revocable`, `missing`, `expired`, `malformed`, `invalid`,
  `create_invalid`, `write_failed`, `foreign` (an unsafe session id cannot be traced; stderr only).
- Remediation: inspect with `python3 scripts/authority.py inspect --session <exact id>`. A foreign-session refusal
  means the id did not match exactly; ids are never sanitised.

## Crack-on denial wrong (stuck on, or off too early)

- Symptom: `AskUserQuestion` / `request_user_input` is denied when the user no longer wants autonomy, or is allowed
  right after "crack on".
- Query: `trace.by_reason` for `crack_on/granted/authority_granted`, `crack_on/blocked/authority_deny`,
  `crack_on/allowed/authority_expired_allow`, `crack_on/blocked/crack_on_legacy_flag`,
  `crack_on/ignored/authority_corrupt_ignored` (authority.json unparseable: treated as none; legacy flag still honoured),
  `crack_on/failed_open/authority_write_failed` (user said "crack on" but no authority was written, so nothing is
  suppressed; if the trace dir is also unwritable only the `stamped=0 err=write_failed` discipline.log line remains),
  `authority/refused/authority_refused_foreign`. Inspect with
  `python3 scripts/authority.py inspect --session <exact id>`.
- Remediation: revoke with `python3 scripts/authority.py revoke --session <id>` (also deletes any legacy flag). An old flag
  (`crack_on_legacy_flag`) is cleared with `rm <loop dir>/<id>/crack_on_active` (Codex:
  `$PLUGIN_DATA/sessions/<id>/crack_on_active`). Allowed right after "crack on": the phrase was quoted, backticked,
  negated or asked as a question (by design), or `authority_expired_allow` shows the 24h object lapsed; say "crack on" again to re-grant.
- Baseline note: the old 103 fires / 5 blocks figure (`docs/graph-alignment-measurement.md`) came from discipline-log
  telemetry; after-numbers come from trace rows, so they are not comparable. Reproduce:
  `python3 scripts/measure_graph_alignment.py --root . --json`.

## Diff-manifest check warned or refused

- Symptom: `push.py` or `merge.py` prints `! diff_manifest <code>: <path>`, or refuses with `diff_manifest:<code>`
  (config `diff_manifest: enforce`). `scripts/diff_manifest.py --policy FILE` shows the same verdict without hooks.
- Query: `trace.by_reason` for `diff-manifest/ok/diff_manifest_ok`, `diff-manifest/warned|refused/<code>` (rows are keyed by
  `<repo>@<branch>` or `<repo>@pr-<N>`), plus `diff-manifest/failed_open/manifest_unreadable`,
  `diff-manifest/legacy/manifest_legacy_absent` (policy file without a manifest key; also written by the gate) and `diff-manifest/refused/foreign_session`. Tally them with
  `python3 scripts/measure_graph_alignment.py --root . | python3 scripts/lib/manifest_counters.py`.
- Codes: `out_of_manifest`, `denied_path`, `docs_sync_deny`, `docs_sync_deletion`, `not_linked_worktree`, `special_file_type` (type change, symlink or gitlink).
- Remediation: a real violation means the diff left its declared scope; fix the diff, or widen `unit.manifest`
  (re-register with `add-unit --manifest`) or the policy file on purpose. `manifest_unreadable` means the policy file,
  progress.json or diff could not be read (fails open when advisory; refuses under enforce); fix the path. Set
  `diff_manifest: off` to disable.

## Action-authority hook denied a merge or push (or warned in advisory)

- Symptom: `gh pr merge` or `git push` to main/master is denied with "needs an action receipt (<code>)" (enforce), or a
  stderr "action_authority (advisory)" warning appears. Only when config `action_authority` is `enforce` or `advisory`;
  absent or any other value is off.
- Query: `jq -r 'select(.command=="action_authority" or .command=="action_receipt") | [.outcome,.reason_code]|@tsv' <loop dir>/<session>/trace.jsonl`,
  or `trace.receipts.by_reason_code` from `python3 scripts/measure_graph_alignment.py --root . --json` (deduped by
  event_id). Codes: `denied_<code>` / `advisory_<code>` where `<code>` is one of `no_receipt`, `hash_mismatch`,
  `sha_mismatch`, `expired`, `revoked`, `consumed`, `foreign_session`, `foreign_loop`, `kind_mismatch`, `no_session` (payload had no session_id; traced under session dir `_no_session`), `malformed`;
  `receipt_consumed` (allowed); `action_authority_failed_open` (the hook itself errored and allowed);
  `receipt_approved` / `receipt_revoked` (CLI).
- `action_authority_failed_open`: the row carries `inputs.error_class` (sha256 of the exception class name; compare with
  `printf ZeroDivisionError | shasum -a 256`) and `loop_id` when known; the hook's stderr (hook log) prints
  `action_authority failed open: <Class>: <message>`. A session-less failure is traced under `_no_session`.
- Remediation: mint a receipt for the exact command:
  `python3 scripts/action_receipt_cli.py approve-action --session <id> --kind merge|git_push --command '<exact command>' --cwd <directory it runs in>`
  (receipts are single-use, 1h by default; `inspect-receipt` / `revoke-receipt` take `--receipt-id`). `hash_mismatch`
  means args, cwd or branch differ from the minted command. `foreign_session` can also mean a worker whose
  `session_id` differs from the minter's (unverified guess): mint under the session the hook reports. Or set
  `action_authority: off` in `.coderails/workflow.config.yaml`.
- Scope of one receipt: each guarded segment of a chained command (`a && b`) needs its own receipt; a leading
  `cd <dir>` moves the directory the hash binds (mint with `--cwd` set to where the command really runs). A receipt
  minted with `--artifact-sha` verifies only against the real HEAD (push) or PR head via `gh pr view` (merge, 4s
  timeout; unknowable means `sha_mismatch`, fail closed).
- Codex: the hook is vendored and parity-tested, but `scripts/action_receipt_cli.py` is NOT shipped in the Codex
  package; mint receipts from a coderails repo checkout (same session id) or leave `action_authority` off.
- Limits: a receipt binds approval to an exact action but does not prove a human approved it (a same-user agent can run
  `approve-action`). The hash covers only the command text the hook sees, not aliases, functions, eval/xargs or scripts that
  push (env/sudo/subshell/`bash -c`/`gh api .../merge` wrappers are unwrapped). Limits: scope 500 chars, 8 KB per receipt,
  50 receipts per session (`receipt_refused_scope_too_long`, `receipt_refused_too_many`). Protected branches are main and master only.
