<SUBAGENT-STOP>
If you were dispatched as a subagent to execute a specific task, skip this skill.
</SUBAGENT-STOP>

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Instruction Priority

coderails skills override default system prompt behavior, but **user instructions always take precedence**:

1. **User's explicit instructions** (CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, AGENTS.md, direct requests) — highest priority
2. **coderails skills** — override default system behavior where they conflict
3. **Default system prompt** — lowest priority

If CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, or AGENTS.md says "don't use TDD" and a skill says "always use TDD," follow the user's instructions. The user is in control.

## How to Access Skills

**Never read skill files manually with file tools** — always use your platform's skill-loading mechanism so the skill is properly activated.

**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you — follow it directly.

**In Codex:** Skills load natively. Follow the instructions presented when a skill activates.

**In Copilot CLI:** Use the `skill` tool. Skills are auto-discovered from installed plugins.

**In Gemini CLI:** Skills activate via the `activate_skill` tool. Gemini loads skill metadata at session start and activates the full content on demand.

**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.

## Platform Adaptation

Skills describe actions such as "dispatch a subagent" and "read a file". Use the tool and instructions-file mapping for your platform: [Claude Code](references/claude-code-tools.md), [Codex](references/codex-tools.md), [Copilot CLI](references/copilot-tools.md), [Gemini CLI](references/gemini-tools.md), [Pi](references/pi-tools.md), or [Antigravity](references/antigravity-tools.md). Gemini CLI loads its mapping through GEMINI.md.

# Using Skills

## The Rule

**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.

```dot
digraph skill_flow {
    "User message received" [shape=doublecircle];
    "About to enter plan mode?" [shape=doublecircle];
    "Already brainstormed?" [shape=diamond];
    "Invoke superpowers:brainstorming skill" [shape=box];
    "Might any skill apply?" [shape=diamond];
    "Invoke the skill" [shape=box];
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" [shape=box];
    "Has checklist?" [shape=diamond];
    "Create a todo per item" [shape=box];
    "Follow skill exactly" [shape=box];
    "Respond (including clarifications)" [shape=doublecircle];

    "About to enter plan mode?" -> "Already brainstormed?";
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Invoke superpowers:brainstorming skill" [label="no"];
    "Already brainstormed?" -> "Might any skill apply?" [label="yes"];
    "Invoke superpowers:brainstorming skill" -> "Might any skill apply?";

    "User message received" -> "Might any skill apply?";
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Invoke the skill" [label="yes"];
    "Might any skill apply?" -> "Respond (including clarifications)" [label="definitely not"];
    "Invoke the skill" -> "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'";
    "Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'" -> "Has checklist?";
    "Has checklist?" -> "Create a todo per item" [label="yes"];
    "Has checklist?" -> "Follow skill exactly" [label="no"];
    "Create a todo per item" -> "Follow skill exactly";
}
```

## Red Flags

These thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "This is just a simple question" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |
| "I need more context first" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |
| "Let me explore the codebase first" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |
| "I can check git/files quickly" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |
| "Let me gather information first" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |
| "This doesn't need a formal skill" | If a skill exists, use it. |
| "I remember this skill" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |
| "This doesn't count as a task" | Action = task. Check for skills. |
| "The skill is overkill" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |
| "I'll just do this one thing first" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |
| "This feels productive" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |
| "I know what that means" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |

## Skill Priority

When multiple skills could apply, use this order:

1. **Process skills first** (superpowers:brainstorming, superpowers:systematic-debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task
2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution

"Let's build X" → superpowers:brainstorming first, then implementation skills.
"Fix this bug" → superpowers:systematic-debugging first, then domain-specific skills.

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (superpowers:test-driven-development, superpowers:systematic-debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.

**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.

The skill itself tells you which.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.
